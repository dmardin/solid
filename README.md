# S.O.L.I.D

## S for Single Responsible
Each class should have only one sole purpose, and not filled with excessive functionality.

## O for Open Closed
Classes should be open for extensions, closed for modifications. You should not have to rewrite an existing class for implementing a new feature.

## L for Liskov Substitution
This means that every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for their base or parent class

## I for Interface Segregation
Interfaces should not force classes to implement what they can not do. Large interfaces should be divided into small ones.

## D for Dependency Inversion
Components should depend on abstractions, not on concrete objects.
